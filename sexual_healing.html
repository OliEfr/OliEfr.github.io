<h2 class="title is-3 anchor" id="publications">Scores and tabs for the guitars in Sexual Healing by Marvin Gaye.</h2>

<p class="content has-text-justified">So, picking up the guitar and jamming along <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Healing">Sexual Healing</a>, by Marvin Gaye (1982) is not far fetched. It's really got that characteristic funky-rhythmic groove that's nice to play along. Finding the <a href="https://chordify.net/chords/marvin-gaye-songs/sexual-healing-chords">chords</a> for the song on the usual platforms was easy, however, I could find any tabs or sheet music for the lead and rhythm guitar on the internet. I actually also just found out that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LxPoJ4QoSk">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3VZmChrnVW8JK6ano4gSED?si=e150377dac5f4200">Spotify</a> version of the song are different. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dLRB_OHzIE">YouTube Video</a> does great job playing along the YouTube version. However, it is still difficult to separate the guitars from the rest of the song as a lot is going on in the rhythm group.</p>
