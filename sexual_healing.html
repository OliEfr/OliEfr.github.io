<h2 class="title is-3 anchor" id="publications">Scores and Tabs for Sexual Healing by Marvin Gaye (1982)</h2>

<p class="content has-text-justified">Picking up the guitar and jamming along <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Healing">Sexual Healing</a> is not far fetched. It's got that characteristic funky-rhythmic groove. Finding the <a href="https://chordify.net/chords/marvin-gaye-songs/sexual-healing-chords">chords</a> for the song is easy, however, I could not find any tabs or sheet music for the lead and rhythm guitars. Also, it is worth noting that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LxPoJ4QoSk">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3VZmChrnVW8JK6ano4gSED?si=e150377dac5f4200">Spotify</a> version of the song are slightly different. For both it is quite difficult to identify the notes played by the guitars from the rest of the song as just a lot is going on. I uploaded all sheet music <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-MgnjGg7Q24ECPASsfc-0VBPdNfpRFBe?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

This is the theme played by the lead guitar in the YouTube version of the song, in both piano and tab notation:

  </audio>
</div>

I also add the strumming pattern, as it might be easier to read for some guitarists. Crosses indicate strokes were I play muted strings:

And the lead guitar for the Spotify version:

And I also add the strumming pattern:

The rhythm guitar is very similar for both version. I only show the piano notes, as the guitar just plays the same chords.

As a bonus, I also add the bass notes:

        <img src="../images/sexual_healing/SexualHealing-Bass.svg" style="object-fit: none;object-position: 50% 15%;height: 200px;width: 100%;" alt="SVG Image">
</div>

<div class="has-text-centered my-5">

        <source src="../images/sexual_healing/SexualHealing-Bass.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

    </audio>
</div>

Finally, the lead guitar, rhythm guitar, and base guitar all playing together. I changed the sound of the guitars to a piano, as I do not like the electronic guitar sound in MuseScore. First, the YouTube version (as I like it a bit better):

<div class="has-text-centered my-5">
  <audio controls>
    <source src="../images/sexual_healing/SexualHealing-YouTube_Full.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
</div>

... and the Spotify version:

  <audio controls>
    <source src="../images/sexual_healing/SexualHealing-Spotify_Full.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
</div>


Retroperspectively, I found that using high-quality headphones (Bose 700) it is much easier to discriminate the instruments in the song. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dLRB_OHzIE">This guy</a> does great job playing along the YouTube version. <a class="content has-text-justified">Sheets created with <a href="https://musescore.org/en">MuseScore</a>.
